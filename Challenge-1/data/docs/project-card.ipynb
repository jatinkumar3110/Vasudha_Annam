    "Overview\n",
    "This project addresses the automated classification of soil types from images using a deep learning approach. Leveraging a transfer learning pipeline with ResNet18, the model distinguishes between four soil classes—Alluvial, Clay, Red, and Black Soil—based on heterogeneous image data. The solution is designed for robust, high-accuracy soil type prediction in agricultural and environmental contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement\n",
    "Manual soil classification is time-consuming and subject to human error. The goal is to automate soil type identification from images, improving speed and consistency for agronomy, land management, and research applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset\n",

    "Training: 8 epochs, batch size 32, with WeightedRandomSampler to address class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmentation: Bicubic resizing, color jitter, random horizontal flip, normalization to [-1, 1] per channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation\n",

    "Model Usage\n",
    "Input: RGB soil image (any of the supported formats)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: Predicted soil type (Alluvial/Clay/Red/Black)\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment: Model weights and full model saved for inference; ready for integration into field or lab applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations & Future Work\n",
    "Limitations: Performance may degrade on out-of-distribution images (e.g., extreme lighting, rare soil types).\n",
